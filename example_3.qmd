title: "Example 3"

## Overview

A stripped down version of Example #1, modified to allow key parameters to be easily changed in order to look at the stability of the final results.

Tests and results:

-   Like Example #2, nFeature_RNA is cut at 4000 (not cut actually because it includes all data point from the created object). Now we modulate FindClusters resolution.
-   Changing FindClusters resolution to 0.2 (from 0.5) causes a merge of CD14+ Mono Naive and Memory cells. Likewise a merge of CD8 T and NK cells. Other cells populations remain distinct. Overall, a change from 9 to 7 communities.
-   Changing FindClusters resolution to 1.0 (from 0.5) causes a split in the CD4 T/CD8 T region and a split in the CD14+ Mono / FCGR3A+ Mono region to give 11 communities (from the original 9). The high nFeature_RNA extension of the NK cells remains.

## Compare results

-   Changing FindClusters resolution to 0.2 (from 0.5) causes a merge of CD14+ Mono Naive and Memory cells. Likewise a merge of CD8 T and NK cells. Other cells populations remain distinct. Overall, a change from 9 to 7 communities.

```{r}
# the unlabelled clusters
DimPlot(pbmc, reduction = "umap")

```

-   Changing FindClusters resolution to 1.0 (from 0.5) causes a split in the CD4 T/CD8 T region and a split in the CD14+ Mono / FCGR3A+ Mono region to give 11 communities (from the original 9). The high nFeature_RNA extension of the NK cells remains.

-   TODO

    -   Look at and compare the tSNE results - tSNEs seem to give nice separation
