title: "RNA Seq Analysis"
---

Having experience of analyzing gene expression data with various tools from GeneSpring through edgeR and more recently having followed tutorials on Single-cell RNA-seq data analysis using Chipster (Seurat based workflows including SingleR, CellDex, CCA, RPCA \[Chipster Tutorials, 2023\]), my objective is to go deeper into single-cell analysis/programming with Seurat (directly with R/RStudio) to refine understanding and explore the many possibilities, using publicly available data-sets (since much of the data and software I used or developed over the past 7 years is proprietary).
