Therefore, the default in ScaleData() is only to perform scaling on the previously identified variable features (2,000 by default). To do this, omit the features argument in the previous function call, i.e.\npbmc &lt;- ScaleData(pbmc)\nYour PCA and clustering results will be unaffected. However, Seurat heatmaps (produced as shown below with DoHeatmap()) require genes in the heatmap to be scaled, to make sure highly-expressed genes don’t dominate the heatmap. To make sure we don’t leave any genes out of the heatmap later, we are scaling all genes in this tutorial.\n\nThis following section refers to the paper Normalization and variance stabilization of single-cell RNA-seq data using regularized negative binomial regression Christoph Hafemeister & Rahul Satija (2019). I have this in paper notes as the method to deal with cell cycle genes. Interesting would be circadian cycle - I came across experimental data before that hadn’t considered this aspect in the experimental design!!\n\nHow can I remove unwanted sources of variation, as in Seurat v2?\nIn Seurat v2 we also use the ScaleData() function to remove unwanted sources of variation from a single-cell dataset. For example, we could ‘regress out’ heterogeneity associated with (for example) cell cycle stage, or mitochondrial contamination. These features are still supported in ScaleData() in Seurat v3, i.e.:\npbmc &lt;- ScaleData(pbmc, vars.to.regress = \"percent.mt\")\nHowever, particularly for advanced users who would like to use this functionality, we strongly recommend the use of our new normalization workflow, SCTransform(). The method is described in our paper, with a separate vignette using Seurat v3 here. As with ScaleData(), the function SCTransform() also includes a vars.to.regress parameter."

We identify ‘significant’ PCs as those who have a strong enrichment of low p-value features.\nThe JackStrawPlot() function provides a visualization tool for comparing the distribution of p-values for each PC with a uniform distribution (dashed line). ‘Significant’ PCs will show a strong enrichment of features with low p-values (solid curve above the dashed line). In this case it appears that there is a sharp drop-off in significance after the first 10-12 PCs.\n\n\nn_dims &lt;- 15\n# fast\nn_reps &lt;- 5\n# slow - my laptop is no server\n# n_reps &lt;- 100\npbmc &lt;- JackStraw(pbmc, num.replicate = n_reps)\npbmc &lt;- ScoreJackStraw(pbmc, dims = 1:n_dims)\nJackStrawPlot(pbmc, dims = 1:n_dims)\n\nWarning: Removed 22880 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJackstrawPlot: 15 dimensions, 100 replicates.

    "text": "Cell Clustering\nBlockquote:\n\nSeurat v3 applies a graph-based clustering approach, building upon initial strategies in (Macosko et al). Importantly, the distance metric which drives the clustering analysis (based on previously identified PCs) remains the same. However, our approach to partitioning the cellular distance matrix into clusters has dramatically improved. Our approach was heavily inspired by recent manuscripts which applied graph-based clustering approaches to scRNA-seq data [SNN-Cliq, Xu and Su, Bioinformatics, 2015] and CyTOF data [PhenoGraph, Levine et al., Cell, 2015]. Briefly, these methods embed cells in a graph structure - for example a K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph, with edges drawn between cells with similar feature expression patterns, and then attempt to partition this graph into highly interconnected ‘quasi-cliques’ or ‘communities’.\nAs in PhenoGraph, we first construct a KNN graph based on the euclidean distance in PCA space, and refine the edge weights between any two cells based on the shared overlap in their local neighborhoods (Jaccard similarity). This step is performed using the FindNeighbors() function, and takes as input the previously defined dimensionality of the dataset (first 10 PCs).\nTo cluster the cells, we next apply modularity optimization techniques such as the Louvain algorithm (default) or SLM [SLM, Blondel et al., Journal of Statistical Mechanics], to iteratively group cells together, with the goal of optimizing the standard modularity function. The FindClusters() function implements this procedure, and contains a resolution parameter that sets the ‘granularity’ of the downstream clustering, with increased values leading to a greater number of clusters. We find that setting this parameter between 0.4-1.2 typically returns good results for single-cell datasets of around 3K cells. Optimal resolution often increases for larger datasets. The clusters can be found using the Idents() function.\n\n\n# create the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graph of cells\npbmc &lt;- FindNeighbors(pbmc, dims = 1:n_pcs_chosen)\n\nComputing nearest neighbor graph\n\n\nComputing SNN\n\n# define clusters according to resolution\npbmc &lt;- FindClusters(pbmc, resolution = 0.5)\n\nModularity Optimizer version 1.3.0 by Ludo Waltman and Nees Jan van Eck\n\nNumber of nodes: 2638\nNumber of edges: 95927\n\nRunning Louvain algorithm...\nMaximum modularity in 10 random starts: 0.8728\nNumber of communities: 9\nElapsed time: 0 seconds\n\n\n\n# Look at cluster IDs of the first 5 cells\n# In this case we have 9 levels (0 - 8)\n# The structure is the relation between cell barcode and the cluster (community) \nhead(Idents(pbmc), 5)\n\nAAACATACAACCAC-1 AAACATTGAGCTAC-1 AAACATTGATCAGC-1 AAACCGTGCTTCCG-1 \n               2                3                2                1 \nAAACCGTGTATGCG-1 \n               6 \nLevels: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\n# Each cell that survived filtering above is represented \nlength(Idents(pbmc))\n\n[1] 2638\n\npbmc\n\nAn object of class Seurat \n13714 features across 2638 samples within 1 assay \nActive assay: RNA (13714 features, 2000 variable features)\n 3 layers present: counts, data, scale.data\n 1 dimensional reduction calculated: pca"

By default, it identifies positive and negative markers of a single cluster (specified in ident.1), compared to all other cells. FindAllMarkers() automates this process for all clusters, but you can also test groups of clusters vs. each other, or against all cells.\nThe min.pct argument requires a feature to be detected at a minimum percentage in either of the two groups of cells, and the thresh.test argument requires a feature to be differentially expressed (on average) by some amount between the two groups. You can set both of these to 0, but with a dramatic increase in time - since this will test a large number of features that are unlikely to be highly discriminatory. As another option to speed up these computations, max.cells.per.ident can be set. This will downsample each identity class to have no more cells than whatever this is set to. While there is generally going to be a loss in power, the speed increases can be significant and the most highly differentially expressed features will likely still rise to the top.\n\n\n# find all markers of cluster 2\ncluster2.markers &lt;- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 2, min.pct = 0.25)\nhead(cluster2.markers, n = 5)\n\n            p_val avg_log2FC pct.1 pct.2    p_val_adj\nIL32 2.892340e-90  1.3070772 0.947 0.465 3.966555e-86\nLTB  1.060121e-86  1.3312674 0.981 0.643 1.453850e-82\nCD3D 8.794641e-71  1.0597620 0.922 0.432 1.206097e-66\nIL7R 3.516098e-68  1.4377848 0.750 0.326 4.821977e-64\nLDHB 1.642480e-67  0.9911924 0.954 0.614 2.252497e-63\n\n\n\n# find all markers distinguishing cluster 5 from clusters 0 and 3\ncluster5.markers &lt;- FindMarkers(pbmc, ident.1 = 5, \n                                ident.2 = c(0, 3), min.pct = 0.25)\nhead(cluster5.markers, n = 5)\n\n                      p_val avg_log2FC pct.1 pct.2     p_val_adj\nFCGR3A        8.246578e-205   6.794969 0.975 0.040 1.130936e-200\nIFITM3        1.677613e-195   6.192558 0.975 0.049 2.300678e-191\nCFD           2.401156e-193   6.015172 0.938 0.038 3.292945e-189\nCD68          2.900384e-191   5.530330 0.926 0.035 3.977587e-187\nRP11-290F20.3 2.513244e-186   6.297999 0.840 0.017 3.446663e-182\n\n\n\n# find markers for every cluster compared to all remaining cells, \n# report only the positive ones\npbmc.markers &lt;- FindAllMarkers(pbmc, only.pos = TRUE, \n                               min.pct = 0.25, logfc.threshold = 0.25)\n\nCalculating cluster 0\n\n\nCalculating cluster 1\n\n\nCalculating cluster 2\n\n\nCalculating cluster 3\n\n\nCalculating cluster 4\n\n\nCalculating cluster 5\n\n\nCalculating cluster 6\n\n\nCalculating cluster 7\n\n\nCalculating cluster 8\n\npbmc.markers %&gt;%\n    group_by(cluster) %&gt;%\n    slice_max(n = 2, order_by = avg_log2FC)\n\n# A tibble: 18 × 7\n# Groups:   cluster [9]\n       p_val avg_log2FC pct.1 pct.2 p_val_adj cluster gene         \n       &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt;   &lt;chr&gt;        \n 1 9.57e- 88       2.40 0.447 0.108 1.31e- 83 0       CCR7         \n 2 1.35e- 51       2.14 0.342 0.103 1.86e- 47 0       LEF1         \n 3 7.07e-139       7.28 0.299 0.004 9.70e-135 1       FOLR3        \n 4 3.38e-121       6.74 0.277 0.006 4.64e-117 1       S100A12      \n 5 2.97e- 58       2.09 0.42  0.111 4.07e- 54 2       AQP3         \n 6 5.03e- 34       1.87 0.263 0.07  6.90e- 30 2       CD40LG       \n 7 2.40e-272       7.38 0.564 0.009 3.29e-268 3       LINC00926    \n 8 2.75e-237       7.14 0.488 0.007 3.76e-233 3       VPREB3       \n 9 7.25e-165       4.41 0.577 0.055 9.95e-161 4       GZMK         \n10 3.27e- 88       3.74 0.419 0.061 4.48e- 84 4       GZMH         \n11 8.23e-168       5.88 0.37  0.005 1.13e-163 5       CKB          \n12 1.69e-212       5.43 0.506 0.01  2.32e-208 5       CDKN1C       \n13 8.10e-179       6.22 0.471 0.013 1.11e-174 6       AKR1C3       \n14 5.38e-112       6.07 0.29  0.007 7.38e-108 6       SH2D1B       \n15 1.46e-207       8.03 0.5   0.002 2.00e-203 7       SERPINF1     \n16 1.48e-220       7.63 0.812 0.011 2.03e-216 7       FCER1A       \n17 0              14.4  0.615 0     0         8       LY6G6F       \n18 7.32e-222      13.9  0.385 0     1.00e-217 8       RP11-879F14.2\n\n\nBlockquote:\n\nSeurat has several tests for differential expression which can be set with the test.use parameter (see our DE vignette for details).
